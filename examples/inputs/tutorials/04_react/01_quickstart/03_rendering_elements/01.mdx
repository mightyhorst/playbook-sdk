# Rendering Elements


Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```

Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

>**Note:**

>One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of "components". We will introduce components in the [next section](/docs/components-and-props.html). Elements are what components are "made of", and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.

## Rendering an Element into the DOM {#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom}

Let's say there is a `<div>` somewhere in your HTML file:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

We call this a "root" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to `ReactDOM.render()`:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```


It displays "Hello, world" on the page.
