# HTML Line Breaks
The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break.

Use `<br>` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

### Example
```html
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```

renders: 
<p>This is<br />a paragraph<br />with line breaks.</p>


The `<br>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
