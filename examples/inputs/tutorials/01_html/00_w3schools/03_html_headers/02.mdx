# Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

`<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.

> Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.


# Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

```html
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
```
