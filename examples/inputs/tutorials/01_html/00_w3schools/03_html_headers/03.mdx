# HTML Horizontal Rules
The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

### Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr />
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is some other text.</p>


### Code:
```
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text</p>
<hr>
<p>This is some other text</p>
```
