<h4><a id="user_objects"></a>User Objects</h4>

<p>The User object is what gives mxGraph diagrams a context, it
stores the business logic associated with a visual cell. In the
HelloWorld example the user object has just been a string, in this case
it simply represents the label that will be displayed for that cell. In
more complex applications, these user objects will be objects instead.
Some attribute of that object will generally be the label that the
visual cell will display, the rest of the object describes logic
relating to the application domain.</p>

<p>Using the example of a simple workflow or process application,
say we have the graph below (<a
	href="http://www.jgraph.com/demo/mxgraph/editors/workfloweditor.html">this
example is available online</a>, select the Swimlanes example from the tasks
window):</p>

<p><img src="images/mx_man_simple_workflow.png"
	name="ill_simple_workflow"/><br/>
<em>A simple workflow</em></p>
<br/>

<p>Typically, this workflow will exist on some application server
and/or database. The browser user connects to that server, or some
front-end server linked to the application server and the user's web
application requests the &ldquo;order&rdquo; workflow. The server
obtains the data of that workflow and transmits it to the client.</p>

<p>mxGraph supports the process of populating the model on the
server-side and transmitting to the client, and back again. See the
later chapter on &ldquo;I/O and Server Communication&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The data transmitted will be both the visual model (the diagram)
as well as the business logic (mostly contained in the user objects).
The client will initially show the diagram above. If the user has
permission to edit this workflow they will normally be able to do two
things, 1) edit the diagram, add and remove vertices, as well as
changing the connections, and 2) edit the user objects of the cells
(vertices and/or edges).</p>

<p>In the online demo, if you right click and select properties of
the &ldquo;Check Inventory&rdquo; diamond you will see this dialog:</p>

<p><img src="images/mx_man_vertex_props.png" name="ill_vertex_props"/><br/>
<em>The properties of a vertex</em></p>
<br/>

<p>These properties show the geometry, label, ID etc, but a dialog
could just as easily show the user object of the cell. There might be a
reference to some process on the workflow engine as to how the inventory
is actually checked. This might be an application specific mechanism for
both the server and client to assign some identification to remote
method calls. Another value might be the type of object that process
returned, maybe a boolean or an integer to indicate stock level in this
case. Given that return type, it is possible to enforce constraints with
the diagram and provide visual alerts of if, say, the outgoing edges
decision check does not correspond to the return type of the vertex.</p>

<p>Next, as an example, the user objects of the outgoing edges might
contain a label and a boolean state. Again, the mxGraph-based editor
might provide the means to alter the boolean value. On the server, when
executing the process, it might follow the edges that correspond to the
boolean value returned by the decision node.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the above example is very domain specific, it
is there to explain how the user object maps to the business logic of
the application. It visualizes how mxGraph creates what we term a <strong>contextual
graph</strong>. The context is formed by the connections between vertices and the
business logic stored within the user objects. A typical application
receives the visual and business logic from a sever, may allow editing
of both, then transmits both back to the server for persistence and/or
execution.</p>

<h4><a id="cell_types"></a>Cell Types</h4>
<p>As described previously, mxGraph is the primary API for using
this library and the same concept applies to cells. One basic state of
the cell not exposed on the graph is whether a cell is a vertex or an
edge, this call be performed on the cell or on the model.</p>

<p>There are two boolean flags on mxCell, vertex and edge, and the
helper methods set one of these to true when the cell is created.
isVertex(), isEdge() on mxIGraphModel are what the model uses to
determine a cell's type, there are not separate objects for either type.
Technically, it is possible to switch the type of a cell at runtime, but
take care to invalidate the cell state (see later section) after
changing the type. Also, be aware that the geometry object variable
means different things to vertices and edges. Generally, it is not
recommended to change a cell type at runtime.</p>
