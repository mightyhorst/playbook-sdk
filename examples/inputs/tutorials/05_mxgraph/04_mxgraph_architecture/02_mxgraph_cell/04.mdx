<h4><a id="geometry"></a>Geometry</h4>

<p>In the helloworld example we saw the position and size of the
vertices passed into the insertVertex function. The coordinate system in
JavaScript is x is positive to the right and y is positive downwards,
and in terms of the graph, the positioning is absolute to the container
within which the mxGraph is placed.</p>

<p>The reason for a separate mxGeometry class, as opposed to simply
having the mxRectangle class store this information, is that the edges
also have geometry information.</p>

<p>The width and height values are ignored for edges and the x and y
values relate to the positioning of the edge label. In addition, edges
have the concept of control points. These are intermediate points along
the edge that the edge is drawn as passing through. The use of control
points is sometimes referred to as <strong>edge routing</strong>.</p>

<p>
	There are two more important additional concepts in geometry, relative positioning and offsets
</p>

<h5><a id="relative_positioning"></a>Relative Positioning</h5>

<p>By default, the x and y position of a vertex is the offset of the
top left point of the bounding rectangle of the parent to the top left
point of the bounding rectangle of the cell itself. The concept of
parents and groups is discussed later in this chapter, but without going
into too much detail, if a cell does not have cell parent, the graph
container is its parent for positioning purposes.</p>

	name="ill_non_realtive_pos"/><br/>
<em>Non-relative vertex positioning</em></p>
<br/>


<p>For an edge, in non-relative mode, which is the default mode, the
edge label position is the absolute offset from the graph origin.</p>

	name="ill_non_rel_edge_pos"/><br/>
<em>Non-relative edge label positioning</em></p>
<br/>


<p>For vertices in relative mode, (x,y) is the proportion along the
parent cell's (width, height) where the cell's origin lies. (0,0) is the
same origin as the parent, (1,1) places the origin at the bottom right
corner of the parent. The same relative positioning extends below 0 and
above 1 for both dimensions. This positioning is useful for keeping
child cells fixed relative to the overall parent cell size.</p>

<br/>

<p>Lastly, edge labels in relative mode are palced based on the
positioning from the center of the edge. The x-coordinate is the
relative distance from the source end of the edge, at -1, to the target
end of the edge, at 1. The y co-ordinate is the pixel offset orthogonal
from the edge. The diagram below shows the values of x,y for various
edge labels in relative mode. Note that for a straight edge, the
calculations are simple. For edges with multiple control points, the
edge has to be traced along its segments (a segment being the line
between end points and/or control points) to find the correct distance
along the edge. The y value is the orthogonal offset from that segment.</p>

<p>Switching relative positioning on for edge labels is a common
preference for applications. Navigate to the mxGraph.insertEdge()
function in mxGraph, you will see this calls createEdge(). In
createEdge() the geometry is set relative for every edge created using
this prototype. This is partly the reason for the amount of helper
functions in mxGraph, they enable easy changing of the default
behaviour. You should try to use the mxGraph class API as much as
possible to provide this benefit in your applications.</p>

<h5><a id="offsets"></a>Offsets</h5>

<p>The offset field in mxGeometry is an absolute x,y offset applied
to the cell <strong>label</strong>. In the case of edge labels, the
offset is always applied after the edge label has been calculated
according to the relative flag in the above section.</p>
