<h3><a id="mxcell"></a>mxCell</h3>

<p>mxCell is the cell object for both vertices and edges. mxCell
duplicates many of the functions available in the model. The key
difference in usage is that using the model methods creates the
appropriate event notifications and undo, using the cell makes the
change but there is no record of the change. This can be useful for
temporary visual effects such as animations or changes on a mouse over,
for example. As a general rule though, use the model editing API unless
you encounter a specific problem with this mechanism.</p>

<p>When creating a new cell, three things are required in the
constructor, a value (user object), a geometry and a style. We will now
explore these 3 concepts before returning to the cell.</p>
