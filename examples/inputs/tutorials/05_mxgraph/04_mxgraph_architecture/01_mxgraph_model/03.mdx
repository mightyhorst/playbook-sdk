<h4><a id="model_change_methods"></a>The Model Change Methods</h4>

<p>Below is a list of the methods that alter the graph model and
should be placed, directly or indirectly, with the scope of an update:</p>

<ul>
	<li>add(parent, child, index)</li>
	<li>remove(cell)</li>
	<li>setCollapsed(cell, collapsed)</li>
	<li>setGeometry(cell, geometry)</li>
	<li>setRoot(root)</li>
	<li>setStyle(cell, style)</li>
	<li>setTerminal(cell, terminal, isSource)</li>
	<li>setTerminals(edge,source,target)</li>
	<li>setValue(cell, value)</li>
	<li>setVisible(cell, visible)</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, we will just concern ourselves with the add and
remove, as well as the geometry and style editing methods. Note that
these are not core API methods, as usual these methods are on the
mxGraph class, where appropriate, and they perform the update
encapsulation for you.</p>

<p><em>Design Background</em> - Some people are confused by the
presence of visual information being stored by the model. These
attributes comprise cell positioning, visibility and collapsed state.
The model stores the default state of these attributes, providing a
common place to set them on a per-cell basis, whereas, views can
override the values on a per-view basis. The model is simply the first
common place in the architecture where these attributes can be set on a
global basis. Remember, this is a graph <em>visualization</em> library,
the visualization part is the core functionality.</p>

<h5><a id="inserting_cells"></a>Inserting Cells</h5>

<p>The three graph cells created in the <CODE>HelloWorld</CODE>
application are two vertices and one edge connecting the vertices. If
you are not familiar with basic graph theory and its terminology, please
see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">wikipedia
entry</a>.</p>

<p>You can add vertices and edges using the add() method on the
model. However, for the purposes of general usage of this library, learn
that mxGraph.insertVertex() and mxGraph.insertEdge() are the core public
API for adding cells. The function of the model requires that the cell
to be added is already created, whereas the mxGraph.insertVertex()
creates the cell for you.</p>

<div id="coreapi">
<p><strong>Core API functions:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>mxGraph.insertVertex(</strong><strong>parent,
	id, value, x, y, width, height, style</strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; creates
	and inserts a new vertex into the model, within a begin/end update
	call.</li>
	<li><strong>mxGraph.insertEdge(</strong><strong>parent,
	id, value, source, target, style</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>
	&ndash; </strong>creates and inserts a new edge into the model, within a
	begin/end update call.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><code>mxGraph.insertVertex()</code> will create an mxCell object
and return it from the method used. The parameters of the function are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>parent</strong> &ndash; the cell which is the immediate
parent of the new cell in the group structure. We will address the
group structure shortly, but for now use <code>graph.getDefaultParent();</code>
as your default parent, as used in the HelloWorld example.</li>

<li><strong>id</strong> &ndash; this is a global unique identifier
that describes the cell, it is always a string. This is primarily for
referencing the cells in the persistent output externally. If you do not
wish to maintain ids yourself, pass null into this parameter and ensure
that mxGraphModel.isCreateIds() returns true. This way the model will
manage the ids and ensure they are unique.</li>

<li><strong>value</strong> &ndash; this is the user object of the
cell. User object are simply that, just objects, but form the objects
that allow you to associate the business logic of an application with
the visual representation of mxGraph. They will be described in more
detail later in this manual, however, to start with if you use a string
as the user object, this will be displayed as the label on the vertex or
edge.</li>

<li><strong>x, y, width, height</strong> &ndash; as the names
suggest, these are the x and y position of the top left corner of the
vertex and its width and height.</li>

<li><strong>style</strong> &ndash; the style description to be
applied to this vertex. Styles will be described in more detail shortly,
but at a simple level this parameter is a string that follows a
particular format. In the string appears zero or more style names and
some number of key/value pairs that override the global style or set a
new style. Until we create custom styles, we will just use those
currently available.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the edge addition method, the identically named parameters
perform the same function as in the vertex addition method. The source
and target parameters define the vertices to which the edge is
connected. Note that the source and target vertices should already have
been inserted into the model.</p>
