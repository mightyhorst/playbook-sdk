<h4><a id="sub_graph_drilling"></a>Sub-Graphs, Drill-Down /
Step-Up</h4>

<p>Sometimes, as an alternative to expand/collapse, or possibly in
combination with it, your graph will be composed of a number of graphs,
nested into a hierarchy. Below we see a simple example:</p>

	<em>An example top level workflow</em>
</p>
<br/>

<p>This simple workflow consists of three high level steps.
Obviously, the individual steps contain a number of sub-steps and we
will look at a sub-graph of the <em>Solve Bug</em> cell.</p>

<p>Under the <em>Solve Bug</em> vertex we have created a number of
children to represent the process of solving a bug in more detail, in
this case the process of solving a bug on the <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise">Starship
Enterprise</a>.</p>

<p>In this example, which uses the GraphEditor example, the menu
option shown selected in the above image invokes
mxGraph.enterGroup(cell), which is one of the pair of core API functions
for sub-graphs.</p>

<div id="coreapi">
<p><strong>Core API functions:</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>mxGraph.enterGroup(cell)</strong> &ndash; Makes the
specified cell the new root of the display area.</li>
<li><strong>mxGraph.exitGroup()</strong> - Makes the parent of the
current root cell, if any, the new root cell.</li>
<li><strong>mxGraph.home()</strong> - Exits all groups, making the
default parent the root cell.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The root cell of the graph has been, up to now, the default
parent vertex to all first-level cells. Using these functions you can
make any group cell in the group structure the root cell, so that the
children of that parent appear in the display as the complete graph.</p>

<em>Result of drilling down into the Solve Bug vertex</em>

<p>The same graph expanded using folding instead looks like:</p>


<img src="https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/images/mx_man_top_level.png" name="ill_mx_mantop_level" />

Exiting the group using the "shape->exit group" option, 
which invokes mxGraph.exitGroup, 
brings you back to the original 3 vertex top level graph.
