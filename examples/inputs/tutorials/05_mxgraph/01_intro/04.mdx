<h3><a id="graph_interaction"></a>Graph Interaction</h3>

<p>Interaction is the way in which an application using mxGraph can
alter the graph model through the web application GUI. mxGraph supports
dragging and cloning cells, re-sizing and re-shaping, connecting and
disconnecting, drag and dropping from external sources, editing cell
labels in-place and more. One of the key benefits of mxGraph is the
flexibility of how interaction can be programmed.</p>

<p>Many complex graphical web applications rely on a round-trip to
the server in order to form the display, not only the base display but
also the interaction events. Although this is often given the title of
AJAX functionality, such server reliance is not appropriate for
interaction events. Visual feedback taking longer than about 0.2 seconds
in an application generally seriously impacts the usability. By placing
all of the interaction on the client, mxGraph provides the true feel of
a application, rather than seeming like a dumb remote terminal. It also
allows the possibility of off-line use.</p>
