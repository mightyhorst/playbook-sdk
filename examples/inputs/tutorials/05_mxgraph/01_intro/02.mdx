	What is a Graph?
</h2>

<p>Graph visualization is based on the mathematical theory of
networks, graph theory. If you're seeking JavaScript bar <em>charts</em>,
pie <em>charts</em>, Gantt <em>charts</em>, have a look at the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Charts</a> project
instead, or similar</p>
<p>A graph consists of vertices, also called nodes, and of edges
(the connecting lines between the nodes). Exactly how a graph appears
visually is not defined in graph theory. The term <em>cell</em> will be
used throughout this manual to describe an element of a graph, either
edges, vertices or groups.</p>

<p>There are additional definitions in graph theory that provide
useful background when dealing with graphs, they are listed in the
Appendices if of interest to you.</p>
