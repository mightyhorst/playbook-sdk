<h3><a id="graph_visualization"></a>Graph Visualization</h3>
<p>Visualization is the process of creating a useful visual
    representation of a graph. The scope of visualization functionality is
    one of mxGraphs' main strength. mxGraph supports a wide range of
    features to enable the display of cells to only be limited by the skill
    of the developer and the platform functionality available. Vertices may
    be shapes, images, vector drawing, animations, virtually any graphical
    operations available in browsers. You can also use HTML mark-up in both
    vertices and edges.</p>
