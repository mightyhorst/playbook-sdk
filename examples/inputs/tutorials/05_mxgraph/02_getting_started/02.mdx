<h4><a id="extending_mxgraph"></a>Extending mxGraph in JavaScript</h4>

<p>In JavaScript, there are various ways of mapping the Object
Oriented paradigm to language constructs. mxGraph uses a particular
scheme throughout the project, with the following implicit rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not change the built-in prototypes</li>
	<li>Donot try to limit the power of the JavaScript language.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are two types of &ldquo;classes&rdquo; in mxGraph; <em>classes</em>
and <em>singletons</em> (where only one instance of the class exists).
Singletons are mapped to global objects where the variable name is the
same as the class name. For example, mxConstants is an object with all
the constants defined as object fields. Normal classes are mapped to a
constructor function and a prototype which defines the instance fields
and methods. For example, mxEditor is a function and mxEditor.prototype
is the prototype for the object that the mxEditor function creates. The
<em>mx</em> prefix is a convention that is used for all classes in the
mxGraph package to avoid conflicts with other objects in the global
namespace.</p>

<p>For subclassing, the superclass must provide a constructor that
is either parameterless or handles an invocation with no arguments.
Furthermore, the special constructor field must be redefined after
extending the prototype. For example, the superclass of mxEditor is
mxEventSource. This is represented in JavaScript by first
&ldquo;inheriting&rdquo; all fields and methods from the superclass by
assigning the prototype to an instance of the superclass, eg.</p>
<pre>mxEditor.prototype = new mxEventSource()</pre>
<p>and redefining the constructor field using:</p>

<pre>mxEditor.prototype.constructor = mxEditor</pre>

<p>The latter rule is applied so that the type of an object can be
retrieved via the name of it&rsquo;s constructor using <em>mxUtils.getFunctionName(obj.constructor)</em>.</p>
