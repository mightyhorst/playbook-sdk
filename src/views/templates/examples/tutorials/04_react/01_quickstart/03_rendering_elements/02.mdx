## Updating the Rendered Element 

React elements are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. 

An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to `ReactDOM.render()`.

Consider this ticking clock example:

```js
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```


It calls `ReactDOM.render()` every second from a [`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) callback.

>**Note:**
>
>In practice, most React apps only call `ReactDOM.render()` once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into [stateful components](#next).
