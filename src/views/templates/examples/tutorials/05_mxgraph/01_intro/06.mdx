	Graph Analysis
</h3>

<p>Analysis of graphs involves the application of algorithms
determining certain details about the graph structure, for example,
determining all routes or the shortest path between two cells. There are
more complex graph analysis algorithms, these being often applied in
domain specific tasks. Techniques such as clustering, decomposition, and
optimization tend to be targeted at certain fields of science and have
not been implemented in the core mxGraph packages at the current time of
writing.</p>
