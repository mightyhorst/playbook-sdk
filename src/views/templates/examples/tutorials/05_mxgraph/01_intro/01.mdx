<p>mxGraph is a JavaScript component that provides features aimed at applications that display
interactive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram">diagrams</a>
and graphs. Note by graphs we mean <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)">mathematical
graphs</a>, not necessarily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charts"> charts </a>
(although some charts are graphs). See later section &ldquo;What is a
Graph?&rdquo; for more details.</p>

<p>Being a developer library, mxGraph is not designed specifically
to provide a ready to use application, although many of the examples are
close to being usable applications. mxGraph provides all the commonly
required functionality to draw, interact with and associate a context
with a diagram. mxGraph comes with a number of examples that help explain how a
basic application is put together and showcases
individual features of the library.</p>

<p>Developers integrating the library in their application should
read the section
&ldquo;Pre-requisites&rdquo; below. Given that mxGraph is a component
part of your application, you must understand how JavaScript web 
applications are constructed at an architectural level, and how to program 
both in JavaScript, as well as any server-side languages used.</p>

<p>mxGraph mainly comprises one JavaScript
file that contains all of the mxGraph functionality. This is loaded into
a HTML web page in a JavaScript section and executes in an HTML
container in the browser. This is an incredibly simple architecture that
only requires a web server capable of serving html pages and a
JavaScript enabled web browser.</p>

<p>The key advantages of this technology are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>That no third-party plug-ins are required. This removes
	plug-in vendor dependence.</li>
	<li>The technologies involved are open and there are many open
	implementations, no one vendor can remove a product or technology that
	leaves your application unworkable in practise.</li>
	<li>Standardized technologies, meaning your application is
	deployable to the maximum number of browser users without need for
	additional configuration or installation at the client computer. Large
	corporate environments often dislike allowing individuals to install
	browser plug-ins and do not like to change the standard build rolled
	out to all machines.</li>
</ul>
