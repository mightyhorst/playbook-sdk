<h3><a id="transaction_model"></a>The Transaction Model</h3>

<p>The sub-transaction in the blue block above refers to the fact
that transactions can be nested. That is, there is a counter in the
model that increments for every <em>beginUpdate</em> call and decrements
for every <em>endUpdate</em> call. After increasing to at least 1, when
this count reaches 0 again, the model transaction is considered complete
and the event notifications of the model change are fired.</p>

<p>This means that every sub-contained section of code can (and
should) be surrounded by the begin/end combination. This provide the
ability in mxGraph to create separate transactions that be used as
&ldquo;library transactions&rdquo;, the ability to create compound
changes and for one set of events to be fired for all the changes and
only one undo created. Automatic layouting is a good example of where
the functionality is required.</p>

<p>In automatic layouting, the user makes changes to the graph,
usually through the user interface, and the application automatically
positions the result according to some rules. The automatic positioning,
the layouting, is a self-contained algorithm between begin/end update
calls that has no knowledge of the specifics of the change. Because all
changes within the begin/end update are made directly to the graph
model, the layout can act upon the state of the model as the change is
in progress.</p>

<p>It is important to distinguish between functionality that acts on
the graph model as part of a compound change and functionality that
reacts to atomic graph change events. In the first case, such as for
automatic layouting, the functionality takes the model as-is and acts
upon it. This method should only be used for parts of compound model
changes. All other parts of the application should only react to model
change events.</p>

<p>Model change events are fired when the last endUpdate call
reduces the counter back down to 0 and indicate that at least one atomic
graph change has occurred. The change event contains complete
information as to what has altered (see later section on <strong>Events</strong>
for more details).</p>
