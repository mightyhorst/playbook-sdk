<h3><a id="mxgraph_model"></a>The mxGraph Model</h3>
<p>The mxGraph model is the core model that describes the structure
    of the graph, the class is called mxGraphModel and is found within the
    model package. Additions, changes and removals to and from the graph
    structure take place through the graph model API. The model also
    provides methods to determine the structure of the graph, as well as
    offering methods to set visual states such as visibility, grouping and
    style.</p>
<p>However, although the transactions to the model are stored on the
    model, mxGraph is designed in such a way that the main public API is
    through the mxGraph class. The concept of &ldquo;add this cell to the
    graph&rdquo; is a more natural description of the action than &ldquo;add
    this cell to the model of the graph&rdquo;. Where it is intuitive,
    functions available on the model and cells are duplicated on the graph
    and those methods on the graph class are considered the main public API.
    Throughout the rest of this manual these key API methods are given a pink background:
</p>
<div id="coreapi">
    <p>anExampleCoreAPIMethod()</p>
</div>
<p>
	So, though many of the main API calls are through the mxGraph
    class, keep in mind that mxGraphModel is the underlying object that
    stores the data structure of your graph.
</p>
<p>
	mxGraph uses a transactional system for making changes to the
    model. In the HelloWorld example we saw this code:
</p>


```javascript
// Adds cells to the model in a single step
graph.getModel().beginUpdate();
try
{
   var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello,', 20, 20, 80, 30);
   var v2 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'World!', 200, 150, 80, 30);
   var e1 = graph.insertEdge(parent, null, '', v1, v2);
}
finally
{
   // Updates the display
   graph.getModel().endUpdate();
}
```

<p>to perform the insertion of the 2 vertices and 1 edge. For each
    change to the model you make a call to beginUpdate(), make the
    appropriate calls to change the model, then call endUpdate() to finalize
    the changes and have the change event notifications sent out.
</p>

<div id="coreapi">
    <p><strong>Key API Methods:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        	<strong>mxGraphModel.beginUpdate() </strong>- starts a new
            transaction or a sub-transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
        	<strong>mxGraphModel.endUpdate()</strong> - completes a
            transaction or a sub-transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
        	<strong>mxGraph.addVertex()</strong> - Adds a new vertex to
            the specified parent cell.
        </li>
        <li>
        	<strong>mxGraph.addEdge()</strong> - Adds a new edge to the
            specified parent cell.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
	<strong>Note</strong> &ndash; Technically you do not have to
    surround your changes with the begin and end update calls. Changes made
    outside of this update scope take immediate effect and send out the
    notifications immediately. In fact, changes within the update scope
    enact on the model straight away, the update scope is there to control
    the timing and concatenation of event notifications. Unless the update
    wrapping causes code aesthetic issues, it is worth using it by habit to
    avoid possible problems with event and undo granularity.
</p>
<p>
	Note the way in which the model changes are wrapped in a try
    block and the endUpdate() in a finally block. This ensures the update is
    completed, even if there is an error in the model changes. You should
    use this pattern wherever you perform model changes for ease of
    debugging.
</p>
<p>Ignore the reference to the parent cell for now, that will be
    explained later in this chapter.
