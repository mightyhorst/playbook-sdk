<h4><a id="styles"></a>Styles</h4>

<p>The concept of styles and stylesheets in conceptually similar to
CSS stylesheets, though note that CSS are actually used in mxGraph, but
only to affect global styles in the DOM of the HTML page. Open up the
util.mxConstants.js file in your editor and search for the first match
on &ldquo;STYLE_&rdquo;. If you scroll down you will see a large number
of strings defined for all the various styles available with this
prefix. Some of styles apply to vertices, some to edges and some to
both. As you can see, these define visual attributes on the element they
act upon.</p>

<p>The mxStylesheet holds one object, styles, which is a hashtable
mapping style names to an array of styles:</p>

<em>Style arrays within the styles collection</em></p>
<br/>

<p>In the above image the blue box represents the styles hashtable
in mxStyleSheet. The string 'defaultVertex' is the key to an array of
string/value pairs, which are the actual styles. Note that mxGraph
creates two default styles, one for vertices and one for edges. If you
look back to the helloworld example, no style was passed into the
optional style parameter of insertVertex or insertEdge. In this case the
default style would be used for those cells.</p>
