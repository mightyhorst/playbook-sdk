<h4><a id="layer_filter"></a>Layering and Filtering</h4>

<p>In mxGraph, like many graphical applications, there is the
concept of z-order. That is, the order of objects as you look into the
screen direction. Objects can be behind or in front of other objects and
if they overlap and are opaque then the back-most object will be
partially or complete obscured. Look back to the <a href="#ill_mx_man_hello_struct">
graph structure of HelloWorld illustration</a> above. Children cells are stored under
parents in a deterministic order (by default the order in which you add
them).</p>

<p>
	If we move the cells in the HelloWorld example we see the
	following result:
</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/images/mx_man_overlap.png" name="ill_mx_man_overlap"/><br/>
	<em>Overlapped vertices</em>
</p>

<p>It can be seen that the <em>World</em> vertex is in front of the
<em>Hello</em> vertex. This is because the <em>World</em> vertex has a
higher child index than the <em>Hello</em> vertex, at positions 1 and 0
respectively in the ordered collection that holds the children of the
root cell.</p>

<p>To change order we use `mxGraph.orderCells` </p>

<div id="coreapi">
<p><strong>Core API function:</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>mxGraph.orderCells(back, cells)</strong> &ndash; Moves
the array of cells to the front or back of their siblings, depending on
the flag, within a begin/end update.</li></ul>
</div>

<p>A sibling cell in mxGraph is any cell that shares the same
parent. So by invoking this on the <em>Hello</em> vertex it would then
overlap the <em>World</em> Vertex.</p>

<p>Ordering and grouping can be extended to form logically layered
groups. The cells are drawn via a depth-first search. Take the
HelloWorld example again and imagine that both the <em>Hello</em> and <em>World
</em>vertices have some hierarchy of children underneath them. The <em>Hello</em>
vertex and all of its children will be drawn before the <em>World</em>
vertex or any of its children. If <em>Hello</em> and <em>World</em> were
invisible group cells you then have two hierarchies of cells, one being
drawn entirely before the other. You can also switch the order of the
hierarchies by simply switching the order of the invisible group cells.</p>

<p>The concept of layering is demonstrated in the layers.html
example. Here buttons are used to set the visibility of group layer
cells. This example ties very closely into the concept of filtering.</p>

<p>In filtering cells with some particular attribute are displayed.
One option to provide filtering functionality is to check some state
before rendering the cells. Another method, if the filtering conditions
are simple and known in advance, is to assign filterable cells by
groups. Making the groups visible and invisible performs this filtering
operation.</p>
