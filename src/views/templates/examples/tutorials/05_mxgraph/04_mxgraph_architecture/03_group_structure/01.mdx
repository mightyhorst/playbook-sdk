# Group Structure
**Grouping**, within mxGraph, is the concept of logically associating cells with one another. This is commonly referred to as the concept of sub-graphs in many graph toolkits. Grouping involves one or more vertices or edges becoming children of a parent vertex or edge (usually a vertex) in the graph model data structure. Grouping allows mxGraph to provide a number of useful features:

* **Sub-graphs**, the concept of a logically separate graph that is displayed in the higher level graph as a cell per sub-graph.
* **Expanding and collapsing**. Collapsing is the ability to replace a collection of grouped cells visually with just their parent cell. Expanding is the reverse of this. This behaviour can be seen by clicking the small “-” in the top left corner of the group cells of the swimlanes example in the online workfloweditor example. This is described in the Complexity Management section below.
* **Layering**. Layering is the concept of assigning cells to a particular z-order layer within the graph display.
* **Drill down, step up**. These concepts allow sub-graphs to be visualized and edited as if they are a complete graph. In the User Objects section we saw the “check inventory” vertex as a single cell. Take, for example, the case where a developer is describing each of the vertices in the process as the software processes that perform the task. The application might have an option to drill down into the check inventory vertex. This would result in a new graph appearing that describes in detail how exactly the system checks the inventory. The graph might have the title of the parent “check inventory” vertex to indicate it is a child, as well as the option to step-up back to the next level up.
