<h2><a id="hello_world"></a>Hello World!</h2>
<p>Hello World in mxGraph consists of a simple client-side example
that displays two connected vertices with the labels &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;
and &ldquo;World!&rdquo;. The example demonstrates the following things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Creating an HTML page that links the mxGraph
	client JavaScript,</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Creating a container to place the mxGraph
	into,</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Adds the required cells to that graph.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The source code for the example, helloworld.html, can be found
below and in the examples directory of both the evaluation and full
versions of mxGraph. The HTML source contains two main sections, the
head and the body. These contain the following main elements that you
can consider a template for building a basic mxGraph application:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>mxBasePath</strong>: This is a JavaScript variable
	that defines the directory within which the css, images, resources and js
	directories are expected to be found. It is JavaScript code and needs
	to be placed with in a <em>script</em> tag. This must come before the
	line loading mxClient.js and should not have a trailing slash.</li>

	<li><strong>mxClient.js</strong>: This is the path to mxGraph
	library. If the HTML file is executed locally, the path might be local
	to the computer or a public Internet path. If the html page were
	downloaded from a web server, the path would generally be a public
	Internet path.</li>

	<li><strong>Creation of the container</strong>: At the bottom of
	the code, in the body element, the function that is called on loading
	the web page is defined (the value of onload). It passes in a div
	container as a parameter, that is defined underneath. This div is the
	container the mxGraph component will be placed within. In this example
	a grid background is applied, as commonly used in diagramming
	applications. No other part of the graph visuals are described at
	container creation, other than the background and the container width
	and height.

	<p>Note that the overflow:hidden style should always be used if you
	want no scrollbars to appear.</p>

	</li>

	<li><strong>The entry function</strong>: The main code of the file
	is the entry method executed on page load in this case. This is
	JavaScript code and must be within a JavaScript <em>script</em>
	element. The first lines of any mxGraph application should be to check
	the browser is supported and exit appropriately if not. If the browser
	is supported, a mxGraph is created within the div container and three
	cells are added to the graph between the begin/end update calls.</li>
</ul>

<em>The mxGraph HelloWorld example</em></p>
<br/>

```js
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Hello, World! example for mxGraph&lt;/title&gt;

   &lt;!-- Sets the <U>basepath</U> for the library if not in same directory --&gt;
   &lt;script type=<em>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</em>&gt;
      mxBasePath = '../src';
   &lt;/script&gt;

   &lt;!-- Loads and <U>initializes</U> the library --&gt;
   &lt;script type=<em>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</em> src=<em>&quot;../src/js/mxClient.js&quot;</em>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

   &lt;!-- Example code --&gt;
   &lt;script type=<em>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</em>&gt;
      // Program starts here. Creates a sample graph in the
      // DOM node with the specified ID. This function is invoked
      // from the onLoad event handler of the document (see below).
      function main(container)
      {
         // Checks if the browser is supported
         if (!mxClient.isBrowserSupported())
         {
            mxUtils.error('Browser is not supported!', 200, false);
         }
         else
         {
            // Creates the graph inside the given container
            var graph = new mxGraph(container);

            // Enables rubberband selection
            new mxRubberband(graph);

            // Gets the default parent for inserting new cells. This
            // is normally the first child of the root (ie. layer 0).
            var parent = graph.getDefaultParent();

            // Adds cells to the model in a single step
            graph.getModel().beginUpdate();
            try
            {
               var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null,
                        'Hello,', 20, 20, 80, 30);
               var v2 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null,
                        'World!', 200, 150, 80, 30);
               var e1 = graph.insertEdge(parent, null, '', v1, v2);
            }
            finally
            {
               // Updates the display
               graph.getModel().endUpdate();
            }
         }
      };
   &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;!-- Page passes the container for the graph to the program --&gt;
&lt;body onload=<em>&quot;main(document.getElementById('graphContainer'))&quot;</em>&gt;

   &lt;!-- Creates a container for the graph with a grid wallpaper --&gt;
   &lt;div id=<em>&quot;graphContainer&quot;</em>
      style=<em>&quot;overflow:hidden;width:321px;height:241px;background:url('editors/images/grid.gif')&quot;</em>&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

<p>Important concepts to note in this exercise are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>mxClient.js</strong> is a JavaScript file combining all of the
	JavaScript source code of mxGraph. When downloading from a web server,
	obtaining all the JavaScript as one file is much faster than as lots of
	separate files, due to the overhead of the requests/acknowledgements
	required for each file. The speed increase is usually at least x2,
	although it varies with the capacity of the server to have parallel
	sockets open with one client.</li>
	<li>The JavaScript code and its dependencies are all placed within
	the <em>head</em> element.</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer has, by default, security options enabled
	that cause a user prompt when attempting to run JavaScript from the
	local file system. This can be disabled in the options menu, but note
	that running from the local file system is not a deployment scenario of
	mxGraph, this would only happen during development.</li>
	<li>Your application can be written and linked into the
	application either within the HTML file, or in separate JavaScript
	source code that is linked into the html in the way the mxClient.js
	file is in the example.</li>
</ul>
