<h1><a id="constructor"></a>Constructor</h1>

<p>For subclassing in mxGraph, the same mechanism should be applied.
For example, for subclassing the mxGraph class, first a constructor must
be defined for the new class. The constructor calls the super
constructor with any arguments that it may have using the <em>call</em>
function on the mxGraph function object, passing along explicitly each
argument:</p>

```javascript
function MyGraph(container)
{
   mxGraph.call(this, container);
}
```

<p>The prototype of MyGraph inherits from mxGraph as follows. As
usual, the constructor is redefined after extending the superclass:</p>

```javascript
	MyGraph.prototype = new mxGraph();
	MyGraph.prototype.constructor = MyGraph;
```

<p>You may want to define the codec associated for the class after
the above code (see I/O section of manual). This code will be executed
at class loading time and makes sure the same codec is used to encode
instances of mxGraph and MyGraph.</p>

```javascript
var codec = mxCodecRegistry.getCodec(mxGraph);
codec.template = new MyGraph();
mxCodecRegistry.register(codec);
```
