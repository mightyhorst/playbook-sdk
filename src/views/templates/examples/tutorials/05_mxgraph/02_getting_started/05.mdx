<h1><a id="fields"></a>Fields</h1>
<p>Likewise, a new field is declared and defined as follows:</p>
<pre>
MyGraph.prototype.myField = &lsquo;Hello, World!&rsquo;;
</pre>
<p>Note that the value assigned to myField is created only once,
that is, all instances of MyGraph share the same value. If you require
instance-specific values, then the field must be defined in the
constructor instead. For example:</p>

```javascript
function MyGraph(container)
{
   mxGraph.call(this, container);
   this.myField = [];
}
```

<p>Finally, a new instance of MyGraph is created using the following
code, where container is a DOM node that acts as a container for the
graph view:</p>

```javascript
var graph = new MyGraph(container);
```
