# The lang Attribute
The language of the document can be declared in the `<html>` tag.

The language is declared with the `lang` attribute.

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>

...

</body>
</html>
```


The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, add two more letters (US).
