# The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to specify the styling of an element, like color, font, size etc.

### Example - Color 
```html
<p style="color:red">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

You will learn more about styling later in this tutorial, and in our [CSS Tutorial](#).

### Example - Color and Font Size
```html
<p style="color:red; font-size:14px">This is a paragraph with the color and font size set inline.</p>
```

### Example - Color and Font Size
```html
<p style="color:blue; font-size:28px; font-family: verdana">This is a paragraph with font and color set inline.</p>
```

As you can see this gets pretty long winded. It's also not a repeatable pattern so a better way is using "cascading style sheets" or CSS. We will cover that later.
