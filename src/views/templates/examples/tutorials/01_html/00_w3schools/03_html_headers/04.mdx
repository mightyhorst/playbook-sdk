# The HTML `<head>` Element
The HTML `<head>` element is a container for metadata. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

The `<head>` element is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag:

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>My First HTML</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>

<body>
.
.
.
```

> Note: Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
